# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
The purpose of the Mission to Mars project was to build a web application that would scrape new data on the Mission to Mars with the click of a button. A Python script was written to navigate the webpages to collect the data, which was stored in a NoSQL database, MongoDB. Then, Flask was used to create the web application, along with Python and MongoDB, which was then customized with HTML and CSS.
